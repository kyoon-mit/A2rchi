At it's core, A2rchi is a RAG chat model which takes in a corpus of data and returns natural language output. However, there are a couple of things that make the A2rchi project unique and specialized toward research and education: Along with a native chat interface, A2rchi comes shipped with various other interfaces that enable it to do things such as: give suggestions for answers on a student help forum and help tech support teams answers emails and create tickets. A2rchi's fully customizable configuration allows users to tweak and adjust everything from prompts, to context lengths, to documents uploaded, etc. and is easy to deploy and modify. System Requirements A2rchi is containized and is deployed with a python-based CLI. Therefore, it requires: docker version 24+ (for containers) python 3.10.0+ (for CLI) Install A2rchi's CLI can be used to create and delete instances of an a2rchi deployment and provides the installation needed for A2rchi. To install the CLI, first clone the a2rchi repo: $ git clone https://github.com/mit-submit/A2rchi.git Then, activate a virtual/conda environment and from the root of the repository (i.e. where the pyproject.toml file is) by running: $ pip install . This will install A2rchi's dependencies as well as a local CLI tool. You should be able to see that it is installed using the which command (your output will be slightly different): $ which a2rchi /Users/default_user/A2rchi/venv/bin/a2rchi Secrets Secrets are values which are sensitive and therefore should not be directly included in code or configuration files. They typically include passwords, API keys, etc. To manage these secrets, we ask that you write them to a location on your file system in .txt files titled the name of the secrets. You will then give the location of the folder to the configuration file (see next section). You may also use multiple different folders/locations and supply them all to the configuration. The secrets you are required to have to start a2rchi are: - openai_api_key : the API key given by openAI - anthropic_api_key : the API key given by anthropic - hf_token : the API key to your huggingface account. - pg_password : some password you pick which encrypts the database. Note that you technically only need the API key for the models that you are using (by default openAI), so for the other ones you can just put in dummy variables. (Yes, we know it's not the cleanest way to do it...) Basic CLI Overview A2rchi's CORE launches its chat interface and data management interface. The CORE CLI has the following commands: a2rchi create --name <name> --a2rchi-config <path-to-config> a2rchi delete --name <name> The --name represents the name of your a2rchi deployment and by default the files for your deployment will be stored under ~/.a2rchi/a2rchi-{name} on your local machine (you don't need to do anything with them, this is just an FYI). The --a2rchi-config is a configuration file provided by the user which can override any of the templatable fields in a2rchi/templates/base-config.yaml . Required configuration fields There are a few required fields that must be included in every configuration. They are: name : The name of the configuration (NOTE: this is not neccessarily the name of the a2rchi deployment described above) global:TRAINED_ON : A quick couple words describing the data that you want A2rchi to specialize in. For example, \"introductory classical mechanics\" or \"the subMIT cluster at MIT.\" chains:input_lists : A list of file(s), each containing a list of websites seperated by new lines, used for A2rchi's starting context (more can be uploaded later). For example, configs/miscellanea.list contains information of the MIT proffessors who started the A2rchi project: # web pages of various people https://people.csail.mit.edu/kraska https://physics.mit.edu/faculty/christoph-paus chains:prompts:CONDENSING_PROMPT : A condensing prompt is a prompt used to condense a chat history and a follow up question into a stand alone question. This configuration line gives the path, relative to the root of the repo, of a file containing a condensing prompt. All condensing prompts must have the following tags in them, which will be filled with the appropriate information: {chat_history} and {question} . A very general prompt for condensing histories can be found at configs/prompts/condense.prompt , so for base installs it will not need to be modified. chains:prompts:SUMMARY_PROMPT : #TODO: I don't actually know what this does... For now just link it a blank file.... chains:prompts:MAIN_PROMPT: : A main prompt is a prompt used to qurery LLM with appropriate context and question. This configuration line gives the path, relative to the root of the repo, of a file containing a main prompt. All main prompts must have the following tags in them, which will be filled with the appropriate information: {question} and {context} . An example prompt specific to subMIT can be found here: configs/prompts/submit.prompt (it will not perform well for other applications where it is recommeneded to write your own prompt and change it in the config) location_of_secrets : A list of the absolute paths of folders containing secrets (passwords, API keys, etc.), discussed explicitly in the previous section. Below is an example of a bare minimum condifiguration file: # stored in file example_conf.yaml name: bare_minimum_configuration #REQUIRED global: TRAINED_ON: \"subMIT and the people who started A2rchi\" #REQUIRED chains: input_lists: #REQUIRED - config_old/submit.list - config_old/miscellanea.list prompts: CONDENSING_PROMPT: config_old/prompts/condense.prompt #REQUIRED MAIN_PROMPT: config_old/prompts/submit.prompt #REQUIRED SUMMARY_PROMPT: config_old/prompts/summary.prompt #REQUIRED location_of_secrets: #REQUIRED - ~/.secrets/a2rchi_base_secrets To view the full list of configuration variables, please refer to the users guide. Create new instance Now, to create an instance of an A2rchi deployment called my-a2rchi , simply create a file called example_conf.yaml with the contents like the ones above and run: $ a2rchi create --name my-a2rchi --a2rchi-config example_conf.yaml It will take up to (a few) seconds(s) for the command to finish (and possibly longer (minutes or dozens of minutes) the first time you run it b/c docker will have to build the container images from scratch), but you should ultimately see output similar to: [a2rchi]>> Creating docker volumes [a2rchi]>> Creating docker volume: a2rchi-my-a2rchi [a2rchi]>> Creating docker volume: a2rchi-pg-my-a2rchi [a2rchi]>> Creating docker volume: a2rchi-grafana-my-a2rchi [a2rchi]>> Preparing Grafana [a2rchi]>> Preparing Postgres [a2rchi]>> Preparing Compose [a2rchi]>> Starting docker compose ... ...

This section covers some useful notes to keep in mind. Running multiple deployments on the same machine The CLI is built to allow multiple deployments to run on the same daemon. The docker networks between all the deployments are seperate, so there is very little risk of them accidentally communicating with one another. However, one thing to be careful of is the external ports. Suppose you're running two deployments and both of them are running the chat on port 8000. There is no way to view both deployments at the same time from the same port, so instead you should split to forwarding the deployments to other external ports. Generally, this can be done in the configuration: interfaces: chat_app: EXTERNAL_PORT: 1000 uploader_app: EXTERNAL_PORT: 1001 grafana: EXTERNAL_PORT: 1002 utils: data_manager: chromadb_external_port: 1050 Persisting data between deployments Do docker volumes persist between deployments? I don't know yet.
